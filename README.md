In this lab assignment, you will practice building a scalable serverless machine learning system, consisting of a feature pipeline, a training pipeline, a batch inference pipeline, and a user interface (one for interactive querying, one as a dashboard).

In the first task, you will build and run the Iris Flower Dataset as a serverless system. 

In the second task, you will build a similar serverless ML service for the Titantic passenger survival dataset. You need to write the source code for this task yourself. It is a good idea to use the Iris Flower Dataset source code as a basis for building the Titantic service.
