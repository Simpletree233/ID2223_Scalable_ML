## Model Performance
We used a model centric approach to improve the permance as possible under a constraint of computational resources. To achieve this, we modify the configurations as follows:

1. Initially, under... the WER is ...
2. Then, we changed ... ,this is becauses...
3. the fianl..

## Program refactor

1. Feature enginerring pipeline on CPU


2. Training pipeline on GPUs
  1. Checkpoint
